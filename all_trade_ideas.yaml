    CLOSED (24/02 - 9.35)

    Take profit: 9,25

    Stop loss: 9,80/ moved at 9.60 (BE)

    PARTIALLY CLOSED: We decided to close 70% of a position. The recent rally spurring
    risk appetite might be coming to an end and a general risk-off attitude which
    we have seen since the very beginning of the year is a major risk factor for our
    trade. We still see a potential for a continuation of a drop from a fundamental
    perspective, but we also think it is smart to partially take profit and eventually
    enter shorts once again on higher levels. There are also technical signs pointing
    to a reversal with numerous dojis on H4 interval.



    UPDATE:Our scenario has been materialized. Depreciation of SEK after Riksbanks
    decision was temporary so we decided to movee SL to BE at 9.60.


    Justification (11/02/2016): As we mentioned in our latest currency report, we
    decided to open a short EURSEK position following the Riksbank decision to cut
    interest rates. As Swedish monetary authorities decided to cut rates by 15 basis
    points, the pair grew increased above 9,60. Rates differentials as well as the
    level of trade weighted index suggests that Swedish krona is oversold versus euro.
    Especially taking the ECB easing stance into consideration. We believe that Riksbank
    is going to switch to wait-and-see mode and is not going to introduce FX interventions
    anytime soon. Current levels provide a good opportunity for EURSEK to correct
    lower in the mid-term

    Update: Weaker piece of data from US favors a leg higher on EURUSD. However the
    overall pressure has been bearish thus we secure a position moving SL to BE.

    Justification:Price reached a target fo a correction which we pointed out weeks
    before. The psychological 1.10 level has been touched and it confluences with
    a crucial support area, containing numerousformer local highs.

    On smaller intervals we observe a double bottom pattern heralding a possible reversal.
    If the recent rally on risky assets, especially stocks starts slowing down, bullish
    trend on EURUSD may be renewed.
