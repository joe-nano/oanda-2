    channel has been broken above. GBP is extremely oversold especially against Antipodean
    currencies which still have a bearish fundamental outlook. Move, at least towards
    the nearest resistance is likely. We are within the crucial support area, taken
    from a weeklyinterval. There is a forming piercing pattern on a daily interval
    and a possible engulfing (both pointing to a reversal). On a weekly interval we
    have seen a marubozu, breaking belowthe lower bound of the channel, and flag pattern
    but a week is not over yet and we may observe a leg higher, even a pinbar.

    On M30 we observe a pinbar slightly below the resistance, candlestick should be

    CLOSED (24/02 - 9.35)

    Take profit: 9,25

    Stop loss: 9,80/ moved at 9.60 (BE)

    PARTIALLY CLOSED: We decided to close 70% of a position. The recent rally spurring
    risk appetite might be coming to an end and a general risk-off attitude which
    we have seen since the very beginning of the year is a major risk factor for our
    trade. We still see a potential for a continuation of a drop from a fundamental
    perspective, but we also think it is smart to partially take profit and eventually
    enter shorts once again on higher levels. There are also technical signs pointing
    to a reversal with numerous dojis on H4 interval.



    UPDATE:Our scenario has been materialized. Depreciation of SEK after Riksbanks
    decision was temporary so we decided to movee SL to BE at 9.60.


    Justification (11/02/2016): As we mentioned in our latest currency report, we
    decided to open a short EURSEK position following the Riksbank decision to cut
    interest rates. As Swedish monetary authorities decided to cut rates by 15 basis
    points, the pair grew increased above 9,60. Rates differentials as well as the
    level of trade weighted index suggests that Swedish krona is oversold versus euro.
    Especially taking the ECB easing stance into consideration. We believe that Riksbank
    is going to switch to wait-and-see mode and is not going to introduce FX interventions
    anytime soon. Current levels provide a good opportunity for EURSEK to correct
    lower in the mid-term

    Justification:The psychological level - 1.40 has been touched but not broken below
    with a massive momentum it is currently beingrespected, a lot of TP has probably
    been hit and with profit taking we may see a move higher especially after the
    double bottom on M5. We see formed reversal pattern on higher intervals, starting
    with a bullish harami on H4 and a pair of pinbars, tweezzer bottom, on H1. Pound
    is extremely oversold therefeor a leg higherat least towards the recently broken

    Update: Weaker piece of data from US favors a leg higher on EURUSD. However the
    overall pressure has been bearish thus we secure a position moving SL to BE.

    Justification:Price reached a target fo a correction which we pointed out weeks
    before. The psychological 1.10 level has been touched and it confluences with
    a crucial support area, containing numerousformer local highs.

    On smaller intervals we observe a double bottom pattern heralding a possible reversal.
    If the recent rally on risky assets, especially stocks starts slowing down, bullish
    trend on EURUSD may be renewed.

    Justification:As weve pointed out previously, a bearish trend on FTSE is still
    intact and we may be currently observing a dormation of another lower high within
    the sequence. What is more on smaller frames the SHS pattern seems likely.

    On M30 we observe a pinbar slightly below the resistance, candlestick should be
    confirmed. Current levels allow us to short FTSE with a decent RR.

  description: 'EURSEK - short on market (open price 9,6019 as of 11/02/2016)/ 70%
    CLOSED (24/02 - 9.35)

    Take profit: 9,25

    Stop loss: 9,80/ moved at 9.60 (BE)

    PARTIALLY CLOSED: We decided to close 70% of a position. The recent rally spurring
    risk appetite might be coming to an end and a general risk-off attitude which
    we have seen since the very beginning of the year is a major risk factor for our
    trade. We still see a potential for a continuation of a drop from a fundamental
    perspective, but we also think it is smart to partially take profit and eventually
    enter shorts once again on higher levels. There are also technical signs pointing
    to a reversal with numerous dojis on H4 interval.



    UPDATE:Our scenario has been materialized. Depreciation of SEK after Riksbanks
    decision was temporary so we decided to movee SL to BE at 9.60.


    Justification (11/02/2016): As we mentioned in our latest currency report, we
    decided to open a short EURSEK position following the Riksbank decision to cut
    interest rates. As Swedish monetary authorities decided to cut rates by 15 basis
    points, the pair grew increased above 9,60. Rates differentials as well as the
    level of trade weighted index suggests that Swedish krona is oversold versus euro.
    Especially taking the ECB easing stance into consideration. We believe that Riksbank
    is going to switch to wait-and-see mode and is not going to introduce FX interventions
    anytime soon. Current levels provide a good opportunity for EURSEK to correct
    lower in the mid-term

    perspective, but we also think it is smart to partially take profit and eventually
    enter shorts once again on higher levels. There are also technical signs pointing
    to a reversal with numerous dojis on H4 interval.



    UPDATE:Our scenario has been materialized. Depreciation of SEK after Riksbanks
    decision was temporary so we decided to movee SL to BE at 9.60.


    Justification (11/02/2016): As we mentioned in our latest currency report, we
    decided to open a short EURSEK position following the Riksbank decision to cut
    interest rates. As Swedish monetary authorities decided to cut rates by 15 basis
    points, the pair grew increased above 9,60. Rates differentials as well as the
    level of trade weighted index suggests that Swedish krona is oversold versus euro.
    Especially taking the ECB easing stance into consideration. We believe that Riksbank
    is going to switch to wait-and-see mode and is not going to introduce FX interventions
    anytime soon. Current levels provide a good opportunity for EURSEK to correct
    lower in the mid-term

    Justification: Market could have overreacted the Johnsons statement to vote Leave.
    We think that despite bad perspective for the GBP, the currency is oversold and
    current levels create decent RR to long it against specific currencies. For example
    JPY. We see an impressive rebound on equities and general risk appetite - negative
    signals for JPY. With a risk of BoJs intervention and a potential easing in March
    it may be worth a risk. There is also a major divergence between JPY and US500
    (stocks in general).

  description: 'Short at market ( 1912.5), CLOSED at market

    SL: 1960

    TP: 1810

    Update: We decided to close the position as risk-on continues. The market ignored
    "Brexit" news and rebounds quite sharply. It seems that a break above an important
    resistance is a matter of time. Fundamentals didnt change and we will look to
    go short from higher levels.

    Justification: Risk factors are still on and we dont think that recent rebound
    has changed the outlook for global markets. Both banking and energy sectors struggle
    as lower interest rates and low oil prices hurt their profits. Whats more, it
    seems that recent rebound of oil has stopped as freezing the output wont help
    the market to rebalance quickly. In addition, majority of companies cut their
    forecasts for the upcoming year, including Wal-Mart, which is one of the biggest
    companies listed on Wall Street. We also notice a correlation between high-yield
    bonds and SP500 that shows a scope for the index to fall further.


    From the technical perspective it seems that bulls struggle to break above 1930
    and recent rally should be seen as a pullback within the bearish trend. If so,
    now is a good spot to take a shot and we decide to go short with a target located
    near recent lows.

    Stop loss: 6090Take profit:5820, 5700, 5450

    Justification:As weve pointed out previously, a bearish trend on FTSE is still
    intact and we may be currently observing a dormation of another lower high within
    the sequence. What is more on smaller frames the SHS pattern seems likely.

    On M30 we observe a pinbar slightly below the resistance, candlestick should be
    confirmed. Current levels allow us to short FTSE with a decent RR.
