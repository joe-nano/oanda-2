'NZDUSD - short at market (open price 0,67586)Take profit: 0,6200Stop Loss: 0,7050Justification (04/03/2016):We believe that the market is underpricing the
possibility for the RBNZ to deliver further monetary policy easing in first half of 2016. Subdued inflation growth, deteriorating inflation expectations and weak commodities pri
ces are likely to overshadow scarce signs of economic rebound in New Zealand. Furthermore looming risks in China are going to drive the market sentiment in the months come. We s
ee scope for further NZD sell-off, especially in pairs with USD.Any person acting on this information does so entirely at their own risk. Any research provided does not have reg
